Hi there, you've reached Aris open API project. You can develop pipes(plugins) for Aris with this project. 

Before you get started, you should probably know what kind of pipe you are going to develop. If you don't know what it can do, please first go to Pipe Store in Aris and check out all the pipes, the source code of which are available in module "pipes". 

Now, let me just walk you through this project. 

The core module is "open", simple and straightforward. You probably don't want to make any changes on this unless you'd like to make a pull request(and join Aris core team:) ). If you'd just like to develop pipes for Aris, please focus on module "pipes" and "sample".

Based on "open" module, we have module "sample" which applies "android" scale. The code in this module is really simple and all you need to concern about is the class "YourPipe".
Before you start makding some changes on thie module, it's important to understand how Aris works and the most important concept for Aris--connection. Please click this link to learn about this concept before you know what you are going to develop.

After you've ran the "sample" module, made some changes, let's move to module "pipes" where you can check the source code for every pipe available on Pipe Store.
